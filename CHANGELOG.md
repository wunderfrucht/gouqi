## [unreleased]

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixing typo in README

## [0.8.0] - 2024-07-03

### 🚀 Features

- Newer api add comment indirection.
Early versions of the Rest API directly added comment information into the output:

"comment": [ ]

This has been changed to provide additional meta-information and the comments moved one level deeper:

"comment": {
    "comments": [ ]
}

The change needs a version upgrade as the interfaces changes.
